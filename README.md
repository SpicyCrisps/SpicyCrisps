## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  You've reached my semi-professional GitHub page! I'm around the web with a different screen name, but I wanted a new dedicated one for my professional pursuits. 
  Maybe one day I'll formally merge them, because I do have cool projects on my private one

  - The Odin Project
  - Portfolio Website
