## You've reached my semi-professional GitHub page! 👋
 I'm around the web with a different screen name, but wanted a new one to tie my IRL info to.
 
 Maybe one day I'll formally merge them, because I do have cool projects on my private one 😄
 
  ## This page hosts professional exercises and portfolio pieces
  - The Odin Project exercises & projects
  - FreeCodeCamp Projects
  - Portfolio Website
  - You _may_ even see a small game or two sneak their way onto this page 😃
